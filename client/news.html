                    <p>Fabinho has revealed he is feeling 'good' as he continues to take encouraging strides with his
                        rehabilitation from an ankle ligament injury.

                        The Brazilian has been sidelined since late November after falling awkwardly during a challenge
                        in the Champions League encounter with Napoli at Anfield.

                        But Jürgen Klopp is optimistic the No.3, Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren will be involved in the
                        squad's preparations for the upcoming Premier League encounter with Manchester United.

                        Speaking to Telefoot, Fabinho said: "My ankle is getting better, I trained by myself this week.
                        I was working with the ball again. I feel good and confident."</p>

                    <h3>The media on Tottenham 0-1 Liverpool: 'A special team Klopp has crafted'</h3>
                    <p>Liverpool increased their lead at the top of the Premier League to 16 points with a 1-0 win away
                        at Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday evening.

                        Roberto Firmino netted the only goal of the game as the Reds got the better of Jose Mourinho's
                        side.

                        Here is what the media made of the victory...

                        Melissa Reddy, Independent

                        Saturday night at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Liverpool served up a public service
                        announcement. The only script they are interested in reading from is the one in which they
                        decide their own destiny, ending a three-decade wait for the title. Firmino’s decisive goal
                        ensured Jurgen Klopp’s side recorded the best start to a campaign of any team in the history of
                        Europe’s top five leagues with a staggering tally of 61 points from 21 matches. It was also a
                        new benchmark haul of 104 over a rolling 38-game period in the division. If you are searching
                        for the secrets to why Liverpool are 16 points clear at the summit with a game in hand, this
                        refusal to be comfortable and get complacent is a solid starting point. The world champions were
                        dominant for 60 minutes in north London, then dug in. Heung-Min Son and Giovani Lo Celso
                        snatched at and spurned glorious chances late on, but the gulf in class between these teams –
                        Champions League finalists in June – was reflected for the most part.</p>

                    <h3>LFC Women v Man United called off due to waterlogged pitch</h3>
                    <p>Liverpool FC Women’s match against Manchester United Women at Prenton Park today has been called
                        off due to a waterlogged pitch.

                        Heavy and consistent overnight rain has left the surface unplayable despite lengthy efforts by
                        ground staff during the early hours.

                        The Women’s Super League fixture was due to kick off at 12pm GMT but the referee inspected the
                        pitch on arrival at the stadium and called the game off.

                        Information about a rescheduled fixture and ticket refunds will be released in due course.

                        Liverpool FC Women would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused to supporters.</p>
